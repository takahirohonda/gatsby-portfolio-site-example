## Good articles to read about crypto

- [How does a blockchain work - Simply Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSo_EIwHSd4)

Good intro, but a lot of things are too high level. Not enough explanation in Proof-of-work.

**Block 1 (Genesis Block)**
Hash: aaa
Previous Hash: 000 (no hash because this is genesis block)

**Block 2**
Hash: bbb
Previous Hash: aaa

**Block 3**
Hash ccc
Previous Hash: bbb

- Hash is like a finger print. It's unique.
- When the new block is created, it validates the previous block.
- Changing a single block will make all following blocks invalid.
- We could tamper with a block and recalculate all the hashes of other blocks to make block chain valid.
- Proof-of-work: A mechanism to slow down the creation of new blocks. Bitcoin takes about 10 minutes to do it.
- When the block is created, it's sent to other nodes and all the nodes try to validate it.
  When the consensus is reached, the block is added to the chain.
- Smart contract is a program stored in blockchain that can be used automatically exchange coins based on certain condition.
