# Example of adding image file to MDX

`<StaticImage>` cannot be used directly in a mdx file.

The standard way to add image to a md file (such as `![my image]("./img/my-image.jpeg)`) doesn't work either.

```js
import { StaticImage } from 'gatsby-plugin-image'

<StaticImage
  src="./img/martina-kimchi.jpeg"
  alt="Martina and Kimchi"
  placeholder="dominantColor"
/>
```
The correct way to use the StaticImage component is to create an component that uses StaticImage and import to the mdx file.

<Image1 />
